# Image Enhancement & Filtering GUI
## Description
This project is a Python-based Image Processing Application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using PySimpleGUI. It allows users to apply various image enhancement techniques, noise filtering, and transformations such as Gaussian filtering, histogram equalization, Fourier transforms, sharpening, and interpolation.

The application is designed to process images with a simple user-friendly GUI while integrating OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and PIL (Pillow) for image manipulation.

## Features
**1. Noise Filtering:**
```bash
-Gaussian Noise Removal
-Salt and Pepper Noise Reduction
-Uniform Noise Reduction
-Adaptive Median Filtering
-Geometric Mean Filter
```

** 2. Image Smoothing Filters: **
```bash
-Median Filtering
-Averaging Filtering
-Gaussian Filtering
```
**3. Sharpening Filters:**
```bash
-Unsharp Masking and High Boost Filter
-Laplacian Filter
-Sobel Edge Detection
-Roberts Cross Gradient
```
**4. Histogram Processing:**
```bash
-Histogram Equalization
-Histogram Matching (Specification)
```
**5. Image Transformations:**
```bash
-Fourier Transform
-Inverse Fourier Transform
```
**Interpolation:**
```bash
-Nearest Neighbor
-Bilinear Interpolation
```
**6. Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

-Interactive GUI for real-time image processing.

-Displays original and processed images side by side.
